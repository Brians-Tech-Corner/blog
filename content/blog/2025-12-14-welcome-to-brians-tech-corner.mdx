## 👋 Welcome

Welcome to **Brian’s Tech Corner**.

This blog is a place where I’ll be documenting things I’m building, experimenting with, and learning about — mostly driven by curiosity and hands-on tinkering.

The focus here is on practical setups, real configurations, and ideas that you can adapt for your own projects.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

Topics you’ll see on this site include:

- Homelabs and home networking
- Kubernetes and GitOps-style setups
- Cloud infrastructure experiments
- Home automation (Home Assistant, UniFi, IoT)
- Backend and automation projects (primarily Python)

Most posts will be written from the perspective of *building things from scratch*, figuring out what works, and refining setups over time.

## 🛠 How This Content Is Approached

This blog isn’t meant to be overly theoretical or abstract.

Instead, you’ll find:
- Step-by-step walkthroughs
- Configuration examples
- Diagrams and architecture explanations
- Notes on what worked, what didn’t, and why

The goal is to make things understandable, repeatable, and useful.

## 🚀 Why This Blog Exists

I’ve always enjoyed breaking down systems, automating repetitive tasks, and building environments that are easy to reason about.
