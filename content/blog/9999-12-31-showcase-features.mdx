## Series Posts

To create a series, add these fields to frontmatter:

```yaml
series: "my-series-name"
seriesOrder: 1
```

This post would then show navigation to other posts in the same series.

## Draft Posts

Set `draft: true` in frontmatter to hide posts from production (they'll only show in development).

## Tags

Add tags to frontmatter for categorization:

```yaml
tags: ["kubernetes", "docker", "devops"]
```

## Custom OpenGraph Images

Specify a custom image for social sharing:

```yaml
image: "/images/custom-og-image.png"
```

## Tips for Writing

1. **Use descriptive titles** - They show up in search results and social shares
2. **Add descriptions** - Helps with SEO and provides context
3. **Use code blocks liberally** - They're syntax-highlighted and copyable
4. **Break up text** - Use headings, lists, and callouts to improve readability
5. **Test in development** - Use `draft: true` while writing and testing
