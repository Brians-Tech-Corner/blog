This is Part 1 of a multi-part series on building a production-grade Kubernetes homelab from scratch.
</Callout>

## Why Kubernetes at Home?

Running Kubernetes in a homelab might seem like overkill, but it's an incredible learning platform and a powerful way to self-host applications with professional-grade tooling.

In this series, I'll walk through building a complete K3s-based homelab that includes:

- **Infrastructure as Code** with GitOps practices
- **Automated deployments** with ArgoCD
- **Secure ingress** with cert-manager and Let's Encrypt
- **Monitoring and observability** with Prometheus and Grafana
- **Storage management** with Longhorn
- **Backup and disaster recovery**

## Hardware Requirements

You don't need enterprise-grade servers to run Kubernetes. Here's what I'm using:

### Option 1: Raspberry Pi Cluster (Budget-Friendly)
- 3-4 Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB RAM)
- Gigabit network switch
- Quality USB-C power supplies
- MicroSD cards or USB SSDs

**Cost:** ~$300-500

### Option 2: Mini PC Cluster (Recommended)
- 3x Intel NUC or similar mini PCs
- 16GB RAM each
- 500GB NVMe SSD each
- Gigabit or 10GbE networking

**Cost:** ~$800-1200

### Option 3: Server-Grade Hardware
- Dell PowerEdge R730 or similar
- 128GB RAM
- Multiple SSDs
- Dedicated networking

**Cost:** ~$500-800 (used market)

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this series, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

1. **Kubernetes Fundamentals**
   - Pods, Services, Deployments
   - ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Persistent storage
   - Networking and ingress

2. **GitOps Workflow**
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Automated deployments
   - Rollback strategies
   - Version control for infrastructure

3. **Production Best Practices**
   - High availability
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Security hardening
   - Backup and recovery

4. **Real Applications**
   - Self-hosted services
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Databases and stateful apps
   - Home automation integration

## Series Overview

Here's what we'll cover in upcoming posts:

1. **Introduction** (this post) - Planning and hardware
2. **Setting Up K3s** - Installing and configuring the cluster
3. **GitOps with ArgoCD** - Automated deployment workflow
4. **Storage with Longhorn** - Distributed block storage
5. **Ingress and Certificates** - Traefik and cert-manager setup
6. **Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki
7. **Deploying Real Apps** - Practical examples

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, you should have:

- Basic Linux command line knowledge
- Understanding of containers and Docker
- A willingness to troubleshoot (things will break!)
- Patience (Kubernetes has a learning curve)

## What's Next?

In the next post, we'll get our hands dirty by:

- Installing K3s on our cluster nodes
- Configuring kubectl access
- Deploying our first application
- Setting up basic networking
