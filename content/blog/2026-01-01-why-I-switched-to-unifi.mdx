For a long time, my homelab network was built around a mix of consumer-grade gear. It worked fine for day-to-day internet usage, streaming, and basic devices.  However the moment I tried to build something *serious* on top of it, the cracks showed fast.

This post is about **why I replaced that setup with UniFi**, what problems it immediately solved, and how that decision became the foundation for everything that followed: Proxmox, Kubernetes, ingress, storage, and GitOps.

## Who This Post Is For

This post is for:
- Homelab builders moving beyond a flat home network
- Anyone planning to run Proxmox, Kubernetes, or both
- Engineers who want production-like networking at home

If you’re looking for step-by-step UniFi screenshots or exact port profile configs, those will come later.  
This post is about **why the network matters first**, before diving into Proxmox bridges, trunking, and VLAN tagging.

## The Problem With “It Works Fine”

My old network setup was good enough for:
- laptops
- phones
- smart TVs
- basic IoT devices

What it was *not* good at:
- VLANs
- predictable routing
- debugging traffic paths
- separating infrastructure from home devices

As soon as I started planning a Kubernetes homelab, I realized something important:

> If the network is a black box, every Kubernetes issue looks the same.

I needed visibility, control, and consistency — not just “internet works.”

## UniFi Hardware Overview

Before getting into VLANs and network design, it helps to understand the UniFi components involved.

This isn’t a product review, it’s a quick overview of the roles each device plays in the network.

### UniFi Gateway
The gateway is responsible for:
- Routing between networks
- DHCP per VLAN
- Firewall rules and inter-VLAN access
- Acting as the control point for network policy

This is where the “network brain” lives.

### UniFi Managed Switches
The switches are what made VLANs practical:
- End-to-end VLAN awareness
- Trunk links between switches
- Access ports for individual devices
- Visibility into tagged vs untagged traffic

Without managed switching everywhere, VLAN designs fall apart.

### UniFi Access Points
Access points integrate directly with the same controller:
- SSIDs map cleanly to VLANs
- Wireless and wired devices follow the same network rules
- No special handling for Wi-Fi vs Ethernet

From the network’s perspective, Wi-Fi became just another access layer.


---

## Why UniFi

I didn’t move to UniFi because it’s trendy. I moved because I needed:

- Managed switching
- First-class VLAN support
- Centralized visibility
- Real firewall rules
- A layout that mirrors production environments

UniFi hit the right balance:
- More capable than consumer gear
- Less heavy than full enterprise networking
- Opinionated enough to guide you, but flexible enough to break things (and learn)

Most importantly, UniFi makes **network intent explicit**.

---

## Replacing the Old Gear

The transition wasn’t just a swap, it was a redesign.

### What Changed
- Consumer switches → **managed UniFi switches**
- Flat network → **segmented VLANs**
- Implicit behavior → **explicit configuration**
- “Try things until it works” → **traceable traffic paths**

This was the first time I could look at my network and *explain why traffic behaved the way it did*.

## Network Architecture: Before and After

To visualize the transformation, here's what the network looked like before and after the UniFi migration.

## Introducing VLANs (The Real Turning Point)

Once UniFi was in place, VLANs stopped being theoretical and became practical.

In UniFi terms, this meant:
- Creating a new Network for infrastructure
- Assigning it VLAN ID `30`
- Letting UniFi handle DHCP and routing for that subnet
- Applying firewall rules intentionally instead of relying on defaults

Nothing magical, just making the network explicit instead of implied.


### Kubernetes VLAN
I created a dedicated VLAN specifically for infrastructure:

- VLAN ID: `30`
- Subnet: `192.168.30.0/24`
- Purpose: Proxmox host + Kubernetes nodes

This immediately gave me:
- Isolation from the home LAN
- Predictable IP addressing
- The ability to apply targeted firewall rules
- A clean boundary between “home” and “lab”

Kubernetes no longer lived “somewhere on my network”, it lived *in its own environment*.

---

## UniFi Concepts That Show Up Later

I don’t configure everything in this post, but these concepts come up repeatedly in future posts:

- **Networks** – VLAN-backed subnets with their own DHCP and firewall rules
- **Port Profiles** – Where access vs trunk behavior is defined
- **Tagged vs Untagged VLANs** – Critical when working with Proxmox
- **Inter-VLAN Routing** – Explicitly allowed, never assumed

If these feel fuzzy right now, that’s okay the diagrams above are the important part.

---

## Managed Switching: Why It Matters More Than You Think

One of the most painful lessons came early:

> **Unmanaged switches silently break VLAN designs.**

Before fully swapping my gear, part of the network path still went through an unmanaged switch. The result was subtle and brutal:

- VLAN tags stripped
- Devices appearing on the wrong subnet
- Proxmox UI randomly unreachable
- Kubernetes nodes getting unexpected IPs

Everything looked connected. Nothing worked correctly.

Once every switch in the path was managed, those issues disappeared immediately.

---

## Trunks, Access Ports, and Intent

UniFi made a crucial distinction obvious: **trunk vs access ports**.

### Trunk Ports
Used between switches and upstream devices:

- Carry multiple VLANs
- Native (untagged) LAN traffic
- Tagged Kubernetes VLAN traffic

### Access Ports
Used for individual devices:

- Untagged VLAN only
- No VLAN tagging at the device level

This mattered later with Proxmox:

> VLAN tagging happens at the switch not inside the VM.

Double-tagging VLANs was one of the biggest early mistakes, and UniFi’s visibility made it obvious once I knew where to look.

---

## Routing and Firewall Rules

With VLANs in place, routing became intentional instead of accidental.

UniFi handled:
- Inter-VLAN routing
- DHCP per network
- Firewall enforcement

This also explained something that confused me early on:
- Some services worked from Wi-Fi
- The same services failed from wired clients

Different networks, different rules and now I could *see* that.

---

## Validating the Network (My Go-To Checks)

Once things were configured correctly, I stopped guessing and started validating.

Some checks I used constantly:

- Can I ping a Kubernetes node from my desktop?
- Can I reach a NodePort from outside the VLAN?
- Does ingress respond when I force the Host header?

Example:

```bash
curl http://192.168.30.120:31929 -H "Host: argocd.k8s.local"
```

If that worked, the network was correct.  
If it didn’t, Kubernetes wasn’t the problem yet.

That single check saved me hours of debugging in higher layers.

---

## What UniFi Ultimately Gave Me

After the migration, I had:

- Clear network boundaries
- Predictable routing
- VLAN-aware switching everywhere
- The ability to debug ingress and NodePorts properly
- A foundation that behaved like real infrastructure

Most importantly, I stopped blaming Kubernetes for network problems that weren't Kubernetes problems.

---

## Lessons Learned

- Consumer networking gear hides problems
- VLANs force clarity (and that's a good thing)
- Managed switches are non-negotiable for labs
- If networking is flaky, everything above it is noise
- UniFi doesn't prevent mistakes it makes them visible

---

### Hardware Used in This Setup

For reference, my setup currently includes:
- UniFi Gateway (routing, firewall, VLANs)
- UniFi managed switches (core and access)
- UniFi access points for Wi-Fi coverage

The specific models aren’t critical, what matters is that every hop in the path is VLAN-aware and centrally managed.

---

## What's Next
Think of this post as the **network foundation**.

Everything that follows: Proxmox bridges, VLAN trunks, Kubernetes ingress, and storage only works cleanly because the network is no longer guessing.


With UniFi in place, I could finally move forward confidently:

- Proxmox networking stopped being mysterious
- Kubernetes nodes behaved predictably
- Ingress, storage, and GitOps started to make sense
